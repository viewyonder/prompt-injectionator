# 3. Non-functional Requirements

Latency: How fast must the detection be? A 2-second check is fine for analysis, but too slow for a real-time chatbot. Define a target (e.g., < 500ms).

Cost: If you use an LLM for detection, what's your budget per-check?

- Performance targets (latency, throughput)
- Scalability requirements
- Security standards compliance
- Usability benchmarks
- Browser/platform compatibility
- Accessibility requirements
