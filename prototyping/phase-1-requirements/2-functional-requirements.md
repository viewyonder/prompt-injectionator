# 2. Functional Requirements

## MVP Focus
 
What is the single most important function? Probably an API endpoint that takes a prompt and returns a risk score.

Example User Stories:

- "As a developer, I want to send a user-provided prompt to an API endpoint and get a simple verdict (e.g., SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, MALICIOUS) and a confidence score."

- "As a security analyst, I want a simple web UI where I can paste a prompt to test the detection engine."

## Core Capabilities

- Prompt injection detection methods
- Attack vector testing suite
- Defense mechanism implementations
- Real-time analysis features
- Reporting and logging

## User Workflows
