# High-level Architecture

Diagram core components (e.g., injection generator, evaluator, reporter) using blocks/arrows.

Four main components:

- API Gateway: The public-facing entry point.

- Core Engine: The "brains" that runs the detection logic.

- Attack Signature Database: A place to store known injection patterns (maybe a simple JSON file or a vector database).

- Web UI: A simple front-end for demonstration and testing.

System Context:

 Define system boundaries
 Identify external actors
 Map data flows
 Define integration points
