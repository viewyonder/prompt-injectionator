# Phase 2 Design

High-level summary with design principles (e.g., modular, extensible).

- Keep it modular: Design for pluggable attack types (e.g., via strategy pattern) to ease future expansions.
- Use UML or simple flowcharts: Tools like PlantUML can generate from text.
- Consider edge cases: E.g., handling rate limits on LLM APIs or non-deterministic responses.
