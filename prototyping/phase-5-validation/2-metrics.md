# 2. Success Metrics

Define success KPIs, e.g., injection success rate, coverage of attack types.

Detection Accuracy: Precision (how many of your alerts are real?) and Recall (how many of the real attacks did you catch?).

Performance: Average API response time.

- Detection accuracy targets
- Performance benchmarks
- User satisfaction goals
- Security effectiveness measures
