### Major Security Organizations

**OWASP (2025):**

* **LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection** - Top AI security risk
* Comprehensive taxonomy of direct vs indirect injection
* Industry best practices and mitigation strategies

**Google Security Blog (2025):**

* "Mitigating prompt injection attacks with a layered defense strategy"
* Production-scale defense implementations
* Real-world attack case studies

**Hidden Layer Research:**

* [Prompt Injection Attacks on LLMs](https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/prompt-injection-attacks-on-llms/) (Jan 2025)
* [Evaluating Prompt Injection Datasets](https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/evaluating-prompt-injection-datasets/) (May 2025)
* Critical analysis of existing datasets and their limitations

### Key Findings:

* 86% of current datasets are heavily skewed toward malicious examples
* Most focus on "PWNED" style attacks rather than real-world threats
* Need for more balanced, realistic datasets
