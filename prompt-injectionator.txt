# 9. Attacks and Defenses

## State of the Art Attacks

Go beyond basic direct injection. Document examples of:

- Indirect Injection: Attacks hidden in retrieved documents or web pages.

- Jailbreaking & Role-Playing: "Act as a..." or DAN ("Do Anything Now") style prompts.

- Obfuscation: Using Base64, character substitution, or other languages to hide malicious instructions.

- Multi-modal Injection: Hiding prompts in images or audio.

## State of the Art Defenses

Analyze what others are doing.

- Pre-processing: Input sanitization, checking for known malicious patterns.

- In-processing: Using instruction-tuned models as "guardrails" or LLM-based firewalls.

- Post-processing: Checking the LLM's output for markers of a successful injection (e.g., "Sure, here is...") before sending it to the user or another tool.

## Look at existing tools 

What can you learn from projects like Rebuff.ai, Lakera, or NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

# 2. Functional Requirements

## MVP Focus
 
What is the single most important function? Probably an API endpoint that takes a prompt and returns a risk score.

Example User Stories:

- "As a developer, I want to send a user-provided prompt to an API endpoint and get a simple verdict (e.g., SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, MALICIOUS) and a confidence score."

- "As a security analyst, I want a simple web UI where I can paste a prompt to test the detection engine."

## Core Capabilities

- Prompt injection detection methods
- Attack vector testing suite
- Defense mechanism implementations
- Real-time analysis features
- Reporting and logging

## User Workflows

# Security researcher workflow
# Developer integration workflow
# Automated testing workflow
# Incident response workflow
</file>

<file path="prototyping/phase-1-requirements/3-non-functional-requirements.md">
# 3. Non-functional Requirements

Latency: How fast must the detection be? A 2-second check is fine for analysis, but too slow for a real-time chatbot. Define a target (e.g., < 500ms).

Cost: If you use an LLM for detection, what's your budget per-check?

- Performance targets (latency, throughput)
- Scalability requirements
- Security standards compliance
- Usability benchmarks
- Browser/platform compatibility
- Accessibility requirements
</file>

<file path="prototyping/phase-2-design/README.md">
# Phase 2 Design

High-level summary with design principles (e.g., modular, extensible).

- Keep it modular: Design for pluggable attack types (e.g., via strategy pattern) to ease future expansions.
- Use UML or simple flowcharts: Tools like PlantUML can generate from text.
- Consider edge cases: E.g., handling rate limits on LLM APIs or non-deterministic responses.

Create an Evaluation Dataset: Build a CSV or JSON file with hundreds of prompts. Include a mix of safe prompts, simple injections, and complex, obfuscated attacks. Label each one as safe or malicious.

Benchmark: Run this dataset against your P1 engine and your P2 engine. This will give you concrete proof of improvement.

Automate tests: Integrate with GitHub Actions.
Iterate based on metrics: Run v2 against v1 benchmarks.
Gather feedback: Share on forums like Reddit's r/MachineLearning or GitHub discussions.

An LLM security tool to educate, test, detect, and mitigate prompt injections against LLM-based applications.

# High-level Architecture

Diagram core components (e.g., injection generator, evaluator, reporter) using blocks/arrows.

Four main components:

- API Gateway: The public-facing entry point.

- Core Engine: The "brains" that runs the detection logic.

- Attack Signature Database: A place to store known injection patterns (maybe a simple JSON file or a vector database).

- Web UI: A simple front-end for demonstration and testing.

System Context:

 Define system boundaries
 Identify external actors
 Map data flows
 Define integration points

Detail modules, e.g., "Generator uses templates for attacks like DAN (Do Anything Now)."

Detail the Core Engine. This is the secret sauce. It is a pipeline:

Example Pipeline:

# 4. Security Architecture

Critical here—outline safe defaults (e.g., sandboxed execution), ethical guidelines, and how to prevent the tool from being misused.

- Threat model definition
- Security controls design
- Data protection mechanisms
- Authentication/authorization
- Audit logging strategy

## Threat Modeling 
 
 Think about how an attacker could abuse your service. Could they use your API to test and refine their own attacks? Implement rate limiting and authentication (simple API keys are fine for a prototype).
</file>

<file path="prototyping/phase-3-specifications/1-api-specification.md">
# 1. API Specification

If backend-focused, use OpenAPI/Swagger for endpoints (e.g., POST /inject with prompt payload).

## Detection API

 Endpoint definitions
 Request/response formats
 Error handling
 Rate limiting

## Testing API

 Attack simulation endpoints
 Batch testing capabilities
 Result retrieval methods
</file>

<file path="prototyping/phase-3-specifications/5-core-engine-specification.md">
# 5. Core Engine Specification

Pseudo-code for the injection logic, e.g., combining base prompt with payloads.

Specify the logic. How do you combine signals from your detection pipeline into a final score? Is it a weighted average? A simple rules engine?

- Chaining mitigations
- Parallel execution
- Observability
